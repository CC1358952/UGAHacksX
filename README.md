Purpose: The purpose of our project was to gamify aspects of financial anaysis. We have a section that incorpoates a EBITDA calculator, with a visual effect. Then we have two seperate sections of quizzes of "Financial Ratios" and "Financial Terms" to quiz the user on financial terms. They quizzed on balance sheet definition.
Tools utilized: VS Code CoPilot, chatGPT
Problems we ran into: The biggest problem we ran into was creating seperate pages for each of the aspects of the app, then being able to use the data in one file to another, and update them at the same time, like the information in Profile, that gets updated as the user responds to questions.
